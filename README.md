**Branching model**

- `feature/fix/etc` -> `alpha`
- Merging commits into the alpha branch will automatically deploy to alpha.
- The master branch serves as the "production" branch.
- The master branch pipeline has a manual _version bump_ step.
- That step will build/push a docker image to ECR with the version tag.
- alpha branch commits are cherry-picked into the master branch.
